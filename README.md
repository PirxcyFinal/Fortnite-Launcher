Allowing the possibility to start multiple independent clients at the same time if you wish.
You will need Fortnite and the Epic Games Launcher installed.

Note:
_Sometimes the game will not launch due to an error. I am working to fix it_

# Installation

> - Put your Fortnite folder path and your command line arguments (optional) in the `config.json` file. [Example](###Configuration-example)

You can add a shortcut of `RUN.bat` file on your Desktop for easier access!
